# Public-IP-Logger
Public IP Logger is designed as a Windows service. Currently, the service will have to be manually installed. Public IP Logger will find your current IP every hour, and log it to the Windows Event Viewer.

Public IP Logger is in a very basic state at the moment, and shouldn't be used in production.
